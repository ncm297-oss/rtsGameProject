# Bugs

One file per bug, filed by the QA inspector (or anyone). The Producer triages them; open S1/S2
bugs outrank new features.

- Name: `BUG-<nnnn>-<short-slug>.md`, numbered in order (look at the highest existing number).
- Status moves `open` → `fixed` (with proof) or `wontfix` (with the Producer's reason).
