# Studio state

The dashboard. The Producer rewrites it at the end of every session. **Owner: read "Waiting on
you" first.** "For your review" (further down) is non-blocking: what the studio built or decided
on its own, explained in terms of what you'd see in the game.

_Last updated: 2026-10-06 (session 2026-10-05-2330, ACCEPT both tracks)._

## Waiting on you

- Nothing blocking. The studio runs on autopilot (chain sessions, self sign-off) until the end
  of the roadmap or a cap/incident stops it.

## For your review

Non-blocking. Each entry says what was built or decided, what you'd notice in the game, and how
to change it. To change anything, write it in `studio/inbox.md`, for example "use formations
instead of clusters" or "make giving up take 2 seconds".

### Stop, hold position, attack-move and Shift-queued orders exist in the rules; the M1 speed target is proven (sim track, M1-7, 2026-10-05)

- **What was built:** three new orders a unit understands besides "walk there": **Stop** (drop
  everything and stand), **Hold position** (stand and refuse to be pushed aside by your own
  walkers; it will fight from there in M4), and **Attack-move** (walk there; from M4 it will stop
  to fight anything met on the way). Plus **Shift-queuing**: up to 8 orders lined up per unit, run
  one after the other; a queued Stop or Hold ends the line; a unit that gives up on one leg still
  tries the next. Replays now record the queue flag (format 2; the old format is refused with a
  clear code; the checked-in golden replay was regenerated and every fingerprint stayed identical,
  which proves no movement rule changed). Also the M1 roadmap criterion "500 moving units under
  4 ms per tick" now has a named, enforced test.
- **What you'll see:** nothing yet; there are no keys for it. The next view task (M2-3) wires A /
  S / H / Shift. Then: select a group, press H, and walkers from your own army route round them
  instead of nudging them off their spot; Shift-right-click four points and the group walks them
  in order.
- **Numbers:** 500 units marching cost 0.67 ms per tick on this PC (budget 4 ms, so 6x headroom);
  2,500 units each with a full queue of 8: 3.0 ms.
- **Producer decisions, revisit any time:**
  - *A held unit still lets its own army squeeze past it in a one-cell gap* (BUG-0055, S3): 10 of 30
    friendly walkers got past a big unit holding a 2 m corridor; enemies never do. This is the
    "your own standing units are soft" rule from M1-5, applied to holders as the brief said. I
    think a unit told to hold a choke should block its own side too (that's what H means), and I've
    scheduled that change for the M1 clean-up session, as long as it doesn't hurt the crowd numbers.
    Alternative: keep holders soft and document it.
  - *Hold, then Shift-queue a move = walk off at once.* A queued order given to a holding unit
    starts immediately (it's standing idle), and starting an order releases the hold. This is how
    most RTSs behave; the HUD must not show "holding" once an order is queued after it (noted for M2-3).
  - *Queue of 8 per unit; a 9th is dropped silently.* The view can warn if it wants to.
  - *One tick over budget on size* (about 1,510 changed lines vs 1,500). Accepted.
- **Rough edges (M1 clean-up session):** BUG-0055 above; BUG-0054 (S3): a hand-built order with a
  flag bit the rules don't know is accepted and then makes the replay file unwritable (no factory
  produces one, and the game doesn't save replays until M6); BUG-0056 (S4): three nits.
- **To change it:** the queue length is `OrderConstants.QueueCapacity` (an engine constant, not
  data); the hold / stop behaviour is a rules decision: write it in the inbox.

### The minimap is in: see the whole map, jump the camera, send troops with a right-click (view track, M2-4, 2026-10-05)

- **What was built:** a 220-pixel map in the bottom-left corner: the three height levels in their
  tints, ramps as small orange ticks, cliff lips dark, the unreachable border darkened; every unit a
  dot in its side's colour (refreshed 5 times a second); and a white outline showing exactly what
  the camera sees (wider at the top, since the camera looks across the ground at an angle). It is
  the first piece of the HUD (`Hud` layer), so later panels have a home.
- **Try it:** `& $env:GODOT --path game`. Left-click anywhere on the minimap (or hold and drag) and
  the camera jumps there. Box-select your army, then right-click a spot on the minimap: they walk
  there, same as right-clicking the ground. Hovering the minimap never scrolls the camera. `-- --no-hud`
  starts without it (clean screenshots). `-- --units 1000 --zoom 60` still runs at 120 fps.
- **Producer decisions, revisit any time:**
  - *Bottom-left, 220 px, square; a non-square map gets letterboxed* (dark bars) instead of
    stretched, so distances read the same both ways. Alternative: stretch to fill.
  - *Same placeholder colours as the 3D terrain,* so what you see on the minimap matches the ground.
    Real biome colours come with the art pass (M6).
  - *Dots are one map cell (2 m) and show the current tick, not the smooth in-between position*;
    at 5 refreshes a second nobody can tell.
  - *The mouse wheel does nothing over the minimap* (minimap zoom may come later).
- **Rough edges (view hardening session, after M2-3):** BUG-0064 (S4): a lone Whirlwind dot is
  nearly the same orange as a ramp tick, and a lone Malazan dot on a cliff lip is nearly the cliff
  colour, so single scouts can hide in plain sight; likely fix is an outline or a 2x2 dot. On maps
  wider than 220 cells (none exist in the game yet) about a quarter of cells would never get a
  pixel. No fog, resource markers, pings or Alt-click yet (M3/M4).
- **To change it:** size and corner are in `game/scenes/Match.tscn` (the `Minimap` node's
  offsets); dot colours follow each faction's `primaryColor` in `game/data/factions/<faction>/`.

### You can now select your soldiers and send them somewhere (view track, M2-2, 2026-10-05)

- **What was built:** when the game opens, 200 placeholder units stand on the map: your army in
  Malazan slate-blue to the west of the centre, the Whirlwind army in orange to the east. Each unit
  is a capsule sized by its body radius from the data (foot soldiers small, cavalry bigger, siege
  biggest). Left-click a unit, or drag a box over several; hold Shift to add or remove; click empty
  ground to clear. Selected units get a green ring. Right-click anywhere on the map and they walk
  there, smoothly at the frame rate (the game ticks 20 times a second; the picture blends between
  ticks). Enemy units can't be selected. The top-left label now ends with `sel N`.
- **Try it:** `& $env:GODOT --path game`. Drag a box over the blue army, then right-click the ramp
  or the plateau behind it: the crowd funnels through the ramp (the M1-5 behaviour, now visible).
  `-- --units 1000` starts 2,000 units (120 fps on this PC, vsync-capped); `-- --zoom 60` starts
  zoomed out.
- **Producer decisions, revisit any time:**
  - *Team colour = faction colour.* Player 0 plays Malazan, player 1 Whirlwind, until M6's match
    setup gives each player a colour of their own. Alternative: a per-player palette now; skipped
    because there is no setup screen to pick it in yet.
  - *Clicks have a 12-pixel minimum radius* so far-away units stay clickable; *Shift + click on
    empty ground keeps the selection* (as in most RTSs); *a click on a cliff face sends units to the
    plateau above it* (the wall belongs to the higher ground).
  - *Start positions are a debug layout*: two half-disc blocks either side of the map's centre, so
    both armies fit the opening camera. Real start locations come with the maps in M6.
  - *Over the size budget* (2,085 lines vs 1,500; about 900 of them game code, the rest tests).
    Accepted because the code is plain and the tests are what make the picking exact (the click
    point lands within 1 mm of the drawn ground).
- **Rough edges:** units turn to face where they walk but don't animate (capsules). With 2,000
  units selected, three right-clicks inside one tick overflow the order queue and the third is
  dropped with a warning (by design; the queue holds 4,096 orders). Two nits for the view hardening
  session: BUG-0052 (S3, a height lookup would crash for a unit billions of metres off the map,
  which can't happen) and BUG-0053 (S4, a test that can't catch a facing sign flip, a stale remark,
  one doc number). Update M2-4: the minimap's right-click uses the same order path.
- **To change it:** unit sizes are the `radius` values in `game/data/factions/<faction>/units.json`;
  team colours are each faction's `primaryColor` in `game/data/factions/<faction>/`. Both are data
  edits (plus a golden-replay regen, which the studio does).

### Crowds route round each other, parked units make way, enemy walls hold better (sim track, M1-4d-3 hardening, 2026-10-05)

- **What was built** (the M1 hardening session: five debt items in one batch):
  1. Walkers steer round other groups' standing clusters and enemy clumps instead of pressing in
     and giving up (the shorter way round; ties go right).
  2. Waiting isn't being stuck: a unit behind traffic that is still moving (anyone's, within 2 m),
     or behind a unit waiting for its path, keeps its patience (behind a path-wait it loses patience
     four times slower rather than never, so a jam always ends).
  3. A unit pushed off its cluster walks back to its spot once the pushing stops, once per order,
     so a corridor can't bounce it back and forth forever.
  4. A pair parked in a one-cell corridor is pushed along by a walker stuck behind it (parked lines
     of up to 3 yield together; a cluster's spot still holds).
  5. Smaller fixes: an enemy standing on your click point is a wall, not a friend (BUG-0037); a
     walker beside an enemy no longer slides into its own standing comrade (BUG-0038); a short
     re-click inside the same 2 m square moves an arrived unit (BUG-0030); a hand-edited replay can't
     declare more than 24 hours (BUG-0040 part 1); the movement tests now run on many maps instead
     of one (BUG-0034/0039).
- **What you'll see:** send one group through another's parked cluster and most now get through:
  111 of 200 walkers cross a mixed cluster (was 2); two groups swapping rooms through a one-cell
  corridor all arrive; the parked pair steps along. Groups sent to four points 6 m apart: 51% arrive
  (was 36%; on the fair comparison 241 → 256 of 500).
- **Producer decisions, revisit any time:**
  - *Accepted below my targets again* (four points 51% / 34% vs 60% / 50%; 64 small groups 19% give
    up vs 10%; walkers crossing their own army's settled cluster 22 of 200 vs 150). Every row beats
    the old code on the same setup, and the cause is the same structural one: the shared path map
    doesn't know where units stand, so four clusters merge into one 12 m mass that walkers from
    the far side can't get round before their 1-second patience runs out. The real fix is a "crowd
    cost" in the path maps; I'm not scheduling it inside M1 and will propose it once the M4 combat
    sandbox shows whether it matters in play.
  - *Found and fixed in-session* (QA): one map in 160 where 94 units walked forever (S1); the
    walk-back pushing the walker it had just let through back off its goal (S2); a re-click
    mid-route making a walker give up (S2).
  - *BUG-0045 lowered from S2 to S3, my call, you may object.* QA found that a line of **five or
    more** standing enemies plugging a passage (for example 5 foot soldiers across a 4 m choke) can
    still be leaked through: your own units shove a given-up comrade into the enemies, and it later
    walks out the far side. This was already true before this session; the M1-5 entry below said
    "nobody gets through", which held for the 3-unit plugs tested then. Plugs of up to 4 units now
    hold, including diagonal ones and ones that form and dissolve mid-push. I didn't block the merge
    on it: nothing you can see depends on it before M4 (units pressed into enemies will be fighting,
    not standing), and it predates this work. It's scheduled for the M1 end-of-milestone hardening
    session. Alternative: reject the whole session over it, losing nine verified fixes.
  - *Perf:* 500 moving units cost 0.17 ms per tick (the M1 budget is 4 ms). At 2,500 units, one tight
    cluster is at 4.5-4.6 ms vs my 4.5 ms slice target (3-5% over the old code the same day), and
    two-player clusters got 2x slower (BUG-0044, S3: the new plug check runs for every touching
    enemy). All beyond M1's supported scale; hardening session.
  - *The old crowd tests measured the wrong thing:* a slot-numbering slip sent both players to
    every point, so they measured enemies contesting a spot, not crowds. Re-set to one player per
    point, with the old code re-measured on the same setup for a fair comparison.
  - *Every map's trajectories changed once* (golden replay regenerated, reason in the commit).
- **Rough edges (all S3/S4, M1 end-of-milestone hardening):** BUG-0044 two-player perf at 2,500;
  BUG-0045 plugs of 5+; BUG-0046 a walker's exact path can depend on the order its neighbours were
  spawned in (replays are unaffected: same seed + same orders still match tick for tick); BUG-0049
  one 64-goal map gives up 75 of 128 (test bound 48); BUG-0050 random-goal give-ups 4.7% vs the 3%
  target (the price of the livelock fix); BUG-0047 test-guard nits. BUG-0028/0032 (crowd targets)
  stay open as the "crowd cost" follow-up.
- **To watch it:** `dotnet test sim/Rts.Sim.Tests --filter "FullyQualifiedName~CrowdRoutingTests" --logger "console;verbosity=detailed"`.

### The game window shows a 3D map you can fly over (view track, M2-1, 2026-10-05)

- **What was built:** the first picture. `& $env:GODOT --path game` now opens a window with a
  generated map in 3D: flat plateaus at three heights (tan lowland, green upland, pale stone top),
  dark vertical cliff walls, orange sloped ramps with walls at their sides, a sun with shadows and a
  sky. The simulation ticks underneath at 20 ticks per second; a small white label in the top-left
  shows the tick number, game speed, how long the last tick took, and the frame rate. No units are
  drawn yet (next view task). Update M2-2: units are drawn now, see the entry above.
- **Try it:** arrow keys pan; push the mouse against a window edge to pan; hold the middle mouse
  button and drag to grab the ground; mouse wheel zooms between 20 m and 60 m above the ground.
  The camera can't leave the map. `& $env:GODOT --path game -- --seed 6` shows a map with all three
  heights in view at the start; `-- --speed 4` runs the sim at 4x.
- **Screenshot tool (for the studio and for you):** `& $env:GODOT --path game -- --screenshot
  C:\temp\shot.png --screenshot-after 2` saves a picture after 2 seconds and quits. Every later
  visual task is checked with it, so the studio no longer needs the optional Godot MCP install.
- **Producer decisions, revisit any time:**
  - *Placeholder colours* (three level tints, ramp orange, cliff brown) are hard-coded in the mesh
    builder for now; biome colours and real materials come with the art pass (M6). Change them by
    an inbox note until then.
  - *Camera numbers from the design doc as written:* 55° pitch, no rotation, 20-60 m zoom, 4 m per
    wheel notch, pan speed equal to the zoom height per second. Alternative: a rotating camera; the
    doc rules it out for readability.
  - *The pure camera/clock/mesh logic lives in `sim/Rts.Sim/ViewApi/`* so it is unit-tested
    without Godot. It reads the sim and never writes it (QA proved this: 100 mesh builds between
    ticks leave the game state hash untouched).
- **Rough edges:** ramps look a little steeper at their two ends than in the middle (about 31° vs
  22°), because heights are stored at cell centres; cosmetic, no fix planned unless it bothers you.
  Three tiny input nits (BUG-0041: a `--seed` with no value swallows the next flag; the start-up log
  prints the largest possible seed as -1; a clock corner case no code path reaches) go to the view
  hardening session. Update M2-2: BUG-0041 fixed. The test scene `game/tests/CameraClampTest.tscn`
  compiles into the game for now; it is excluded when the release build exists (M6).

### Replays and a determinism proof that outlives the session (sim track, M1-6, 2026-10-05)

- **What was built:** a replay file format and player. A replay stores the map seed and settings,
  every command the game accepted (with the tick it was given), and a fingerprint of the game state
  every 5 seconds. Playing it back re-runs the match from the seed and checks every fingerprint;
  the first mismatch stops it and names the tick. One "golden" replay is checked in: 200 units of
  every kind marching across the seed-1 map, 75 seconds of game time, 15 fingerprints, a 15 KB text
  file you can read in a diff.
- **What it means for you:** from now on, any change to movement, tick order, random numbers or
  unit stats that changes how a match plays out fails the test suite until a developer regenerates
  the golden on purpose and explains why in the commit. This is the guard that keeps future replays
  and saved games exact, and it's the backbone of the M6 replay viewer. Update M1-4d-3: the guard
  did its job; the golden was regenerated once, with the reason in the commit. Update M1-7: the
  file format grew a column (format 2) and the fingerprints stayed byte-identical.
- **Also fixed (BUG-0014):** two particular seeds (0 and the largest possible number) used to give
  the same map. The seed is now scrambled before use, so every seed is its own map. Side effect:
  **every map changed once.** Seed 1 today is not the seed 1 of yesterday. Nothing you have seen is
  lost (nothing was on screen yet).
- **Producer decisions, revisit any time:**
  - *A replay is tied to the exact game data it was recorded with*, including display text. Change
    one number in `game/data/` and old replays refuse to play (with a clear code, never a silent
    desync). Alternative: hash only balance-relevant fields; rejected for now because a wrong guess
    there means a desync that looks like a bug.
  - *Fingerprints every 100 ticks (5 s)* by default; file size grows ~17 bytes per checkpoint, so a
    30-minute match is under 1 MB even with thousands of orders.
  - *Six movement tests keep running on their old maps* through a helper that undoes the seed
    scramble, because their pass/fail bounds were tuned to one map. QA showed those bounds fail on
    most other maps (BUG-0039, S3, pre-existing): the next sim session, a hardening one, re-measures
    them on many maps. Update M1-4d-3: done; the helper is gone from those tests and the bounds hold
    on every swept map (one 64-goal map still breaks a bound, BUG-0049).
- **Rough edges:** a hand-edited replay can declare a tick count of two billion and make playback
  spin for hours (BUG-0040, S4; a limit is a few lines, hardening session). Update M1-4d-3: the
  24-hour limit is in. When the AI arrives (M5) the recording point inside the tick needs a decision
  (also BUG-0040, still open for that part).

### Two tracks started: the view track begins M2 while the sim track finishes M1 (2026-10-05, session 1446 plan)

- **What changed for you:** from this session the game window stops being an empty scene (see the
  M2-1 entry above: it landed). Units, selection and right-click orders are the next view task (M2-2).
  Update 1609: M2-2 landed too. Update 2330: the minimap (M2-4) landed.
- **Producer decisions, revisit any time:**
  - *Where the view's tests live.* Dev tests in `sim/Rts.Sim.Tests/ViewApi/`, QA tests in
    `sim/Rts.Sim.Tests/QA/ViewApi/`, Godot-side test scenes in `game/tests/`; `ViewApi/` may hold
    pure helpers with no sim reference (fixed-step clock, terrain geometry, camera limits) so that
    logic is unit-tested without Godot. Alternative: put those helpers in `game/scripts/`, where
    nothing can test them. Now also written into the ownership table in docs/07.
  - *The sim track keeps its public setup API additive* (no new required fields on `SimConfig`, no
    signature changes to `Simulation` or the data loader), so the view compiles after both merge.
    Held this session and the next. Update 2330: held again (M1-7 kept the 3-argument `Move`).
  - *First view slice order:* scene + terrain + camera + screenshot flag before unit views, because
    the screenshot flag is how the studio (and you) verify every later visual task.
  - *Bug numbering with two QA inspectors:* both filed a BUG-0039 this session. From now on the
    brief gives each track its own starting number (view = sim + 10). The view's bug is BUG-0041.
- **Docs drift for you to fix (one line, your file):** `CLAUDE.md` still says "Current milestone:
  M1" and "don't write gameplay code ahead of the roadmap". With two tracks that line is per
  track (sim M1, view M2). The agents don't edit `CLAUDE.md`; suggested text: "Current
  milestones: M1 (sim track), M2 (view track)".
- **Cap note:** `autopilot.md` says 8 sessions per day; the old dashboard said 10. The studio
  follows autopilot (8).

### The M1 headline works: an army crosses the map and climbs a ramp (M1-5, 2026-10-05)

- **What was built:** the proof test for M1's main promise. 200 soldiers of every kind (foot,
  cavalry, siege) start near the west edge of a generated map and are sent to the far side of a
  plateau, so they must funnel through a 6 m ramp. On every map tried (58 maps, plus 20 with a
  climb of two ramps, plus armies of 500 and 1,000) everyone arrives, nobody gives up, nobody ends
  up in a cliff, and running the same march twice gives the identical result tick for tick. The
  march takes 72-127 seconds of game time, under half the allowed limit.
- **What you'll see:** select your whole army and right-click across the map: the group streams
  through the ramp as a crowd, the ones pressed against the ramp's walls wait their turn instead
  of quitting, and the whole army arrives and packs up around the click point. Before this
  session, a few units (1-9 per march) got pinned at the corners of ramps and gaps between
  plateaus, stopped, and stayed behind. Update M2-2: you can do exactly this in the game window now.
- **Producer decisions, revisit any time:**
  - *Waiting in a moving queue doesn't count as stuck.* A unit only starts its 1-second give-up
    timer when nobody just ahead of it is making headway either. Trade-off: a jammed crowd (for
    example behind an enemy blocking a pass) takes a little longer to give up, about 10-14 seconds
    for 60 units instead of 9-10.
  - *Enemy units holding their ground are solid.* QA found that a walker squeezed between two
    standing enemies could slip through a 0.2 m slit (an old bug, made worse by the new patience).
    Now a line of enemies plugging a ramp holds: nobody gets through, everyone behind gives up.
    Your *own* standing units stay "soft" (a walker can still slip between two of them, and can
    shove idle ones aside), because making them solid too cut crowd arrivals in the tests.
    **Correction (1609):** "nobody gets through" held for the 3-unit plugs tested then. Plugs of 5
    or more enemies can still be leaked through by your own units shoving each other (BUG-0045,
    S3, pre-existing); plugs of up to 4 hold since M1-4d-3. See that entry.
- **Rough edges (S3, next hardening session):** if an enemy is standing exactly on the spot you
  clicked, your unit treats it as a friend and stops touching it, a hand's width inside it
  (BUG-0037); and a unit squeezed between an enemy and its own standing comrade can press into the
  comrade by up to 14 cm for a tick (BUG-0038). Neither lets anyone through a plug. Also, with
  500-1,000 units marching, a few pairs end up closer than they should (a known limit of the
  back-off rule). Update M1-4d-3: BUG-0037 and BUG-0038 fixed.
- **To watch it:** `dotnet test sim/Rts.Sim.Tests --filter "FullyQualifiedName~ScenarioTests" --logger "console;verbosity=detailed"` prints each seed's path length, ticks taken and the limit. Update M1-6: the same march is now the golden replay (`sim/Rts.Sim.Tests/Replays/cross_map_seed1.replay`).

### Idle units step aside for walkers (M1-4d-2, 2026-10-05)

- **What you'll see:** soldiers walking through your own idle troops push them out of the way
  instead of stopping. A clustered group bends to let walkers by but doesn't split apart. A lone
  unit parked in a narrow pass steps aside once a friendly walker has been stuck behind it for
  0.5 s. Enemy units and units that are already walking are never pushed. A unit squeezed between
  a standing unit and a cliff can walk away again (BUG-0031 fixed). Update M1-7: a unit told to
  hold position is never pushed either.
- **Producer calls, revisit any time:**
  - Accepted although my own crowd targets were missed: groups sent to 4 nearby points now arrive
    35-44% of the time (was about 16%), against the 60-80% I asked for. The causes are structural
    (pathfinding ignores units; units waiting for a path and enemies act as walls) and were
    outside this task. QA filed them as S2 (BUG-0032/0033); I set them to S3 and scheduled a
    follow-up, M1-4d-3 crowd routing. Update 2026-10-05-1234: that follow-up now waits for the M1
    hardening session (your rule: S3 work goes there), and the cross-map scenario test (M1-5) went
    first because one army walking to one spot doesn't need it (confirmed: it passed without it).
    Update 1446: the hardening session is the next sim session. Update 1609: it landed (see the
    M1-4d-3 entry above); BUG-0033 fixed, BUG-0032 stays open for the crowd-cost follow-up.
  - Units standing on their own click point hold it. So a parked *group* in a 1-cell corridor still
    blocks its own army until you move it (BUG-0033 remainder). Update 1609: a parked pair now
    yields; a cluster's spot still holds.
- **Rough edge:** walkers crossing a cluster that mixes both players' units mostly give up (2 of
  200 in a test, 28 before shoving). M1-4d-3 targets this. Update 1609: 111 of 200 now.
- **To watch it:** `dotnet test sim/Rts.Sim.Tests --filter "PastAFriendlyUnitParkedThereByAMove|WalkersCrossingASettledBlob" --logger "console;verbosity=detailed"`.

### Two studio sessions overlapped (incident note, 2026-10-05)

- At about 12:14 a second session (id 2026-10-05-1214) overwrote `studio/.session.lock` in your
  checkout while session 1013 was still running; your three studio-skill commits (724234a,
  432fafe, c089405) went to main meanwhile. The studio worktree was untouched and session 1013
  finished normally. If that second session is still chaining, two conductors may be running.
  Your "Downloads stay with the owner" inbox note was processed at the 1234 PLAN (reflected in
  the M6 queue line). Session 1234 ran on the studio-session skill as loaded at its start; your
  later two-track (sim + view) change to the skill applies from the next session. Update 1446:
  this session is the first on the two-track skill; no second conductor has shown up since.
  Update 1609: a power outage at about 16:40 interrupted both builders; both were resumed from
  their transcripts with work intact, no second conductor. Update 2330: a quiet session.

### Units cluster around the click point, and give up when stuck (M1-4d-1, 2026-10-05)

- **What you'll see:** select 30 soldiers and right-click a spot. They walk there and pack into a
  tight cluster centered on the click, shoulder to shoulder, rather than lining up in a formation.
  Two units meeting in a narrow pass both step to their right and slip past each other.
  Spam-clicking the same spot doesn't make them restart or stutter.
- **Giving up:** a unit that makes no headway for 1 second (wedged behind a crowd, or blocked by
  standing units) stops and stands idle instead of jittering in place forever. Update M1-5: waiting
  behind a groupmate who is still moving no longer counts as "no headway". Update M1-4d-3: nor does
  waiting behind anyone's moving traffic within 2 m.
- **Producer decisions:**
  - Clusters instead of formations for now: StarCraft-style clumping, where Age of Empires uses
    line or box formations. Formations can come back in M2 with group commands.
  - 1 second before giving up. Shorter feels snappier but units stop short more often; longer
    means more pushing and shoving before they quit.
  - Clicking the spot a unit is already heading to counts as the same order.
- **Rough edges until the next session (shoving):** units that are standing still never step
  aside yet. So two groups sent to spots close together bump into each other's clusters and many
  stop short: in a stress test, 84% of 500 units sent to 4 nearby points gave up 8-16 m early
  (BUG-0028). A unit squeezed between a standing unit and a cliff can't walk away (BUG-0031).
  Both should go away once idle units make room for moving ones. (Update: shoving landed in
  M1-4d-2; BUG-0031 fixed, BUG-0028 partly, see the entry above.)
- **Also open:** a short nudge order (under about 2.8 m, inside the same 2 m map cell) to a unit
  that has already arrived is ignored (BUG-0030). It's in the debt backlog. Update M1-4d-3: fixed.

### Pathfinding: shared arrow maps with a speed limit (M1-4b and M1-4c, 2026-10-04)

- **What it is:** when you send units somewhere, the game computes one map of arrows for that
  destination: every 2 m square points along the shortest route there. Every unit headed to that
  spot follows the same map, so moving 200 units costs about the same as moving one. The game
  remembers recent destinations (32 to 128, depending on how many units the game allows), so
  re-ordering to a recent spot is instant.
- **Speed limit (Producer decision):** at most 2 new arrow maps per tick, which is 40 per second,
  oldest orders first. Each takes about 0.7 ms to build, and the limit keeps every tick inside its
  time budget so the game never hitches.
- **What you'll see:** nothing in normal play. Only in a big burst: order 32 separate groups to 32
  different spots at the same instant and the last group starts walking about 0.8 s after the first.
- **Why it's saved with the game (Producer decision):** which arrow maps are remembered decides
  which units wait a tick, so that memory is saved and checked like the rest of the game state.
  That keeps replays and saved games exact.
- **Rough edges (debt backlog):** with more separate destinations active at once than the game
  remembers (only in very large games with many small groups), some older groups can stall while
  newer ones walk (BUG-0025). In same-instant order bursts, one side of the map gets served
  0.1-0.2 s sooner on average (BUG-0026, cosmetic). Update M1-7: maps larger than 256 x 256 are
  now documented as unsupported until arrow maps can be built in slices (BUG-0023); the design
  map is 128 x 128.

### Terraced maps: plateaus, cliffs and ramps (M1-3 and M1-4a, 2026-10-03)

- **What you'll see:** maps have up to three height levels (ground, 4 m and 8 m up), each a flat
  plateau. Plateau edges are cliffs no unit can climb. The only way up is a ramp, 6 m wide and 8 m
  long with a gentle slope, entered only at its top or bottom because its sides are walled. Ramps
  are natural chokepoints, wide enough for about 7 foot soldiers or 4 horsemen side by side, so a
  few defenders can hold one. In M4 the high-ground rule raises the stakes: units below can't see
  up onto a plateau. Update M2-1: you can now see these in the game window.
- **Cliff edges (Producer decision):** the outer 2 m strip of each plateau counts as cliff, so
  units on high ground stand about one step back from the visible edge. The alternative (walls
  between squares) would let them stand right at the lip but makes pathfinding more complex.
- **Safety nets:** the map's outer ring is impassable, and any patch of ground no ramp reaches is
  sealed off, so a unit can never be stranded. The generator re-rolls a layout that comes out too
  blocked (under half walkable) or missing a height level, up to 8 times (Producer decision), then
  takes the best one, so map generation can't hang. A normal map takes about 4 ms to make.
- Also added: a fast "who's near me" lookup grid that movement and later combat use. Nothing to
  review there.

### First real game data (M1-2, 2026-10-03)

- **What it is:** the Malazan and Whirlwind rosters (7 units each, stats from the faction pages),
  the damage-type table and the economy rules now live as JSON in `game/data/`. The game checks
  every file when it starts and lists every mistake at once.
- **Values the docs didn't specify (Producer decision, first pass):**
  - **Body size:** 0.4 m radius for foot soldiers, 0.7 m for cavalry, 0.9 m for siege. This is the
    one you'll notice most: it decides how tightly crowds pack and how many units fit through a
    ramp at once. Update M2-2: you can see the three sizes on screen now.
  - Per-unit attack wind-up times, faction color palettes, and a placeholder for "requires Age II".
- **To change them:** edit the numbers in `game/data/factions/<faction>/units.json`, or ask the
  studio. No code changes are needed. Update M1-6: a data edit also means regenerating the golden
  replay (the studio does this; it's one command).

### Optional: Godot MCP server (M0)

- A tool that lets Claude launch the game and take screenshots more easily. Not needed: since
  M2-1 the game has its own `--screenshot` flag, which covers the studio's need.

## Requests for the sim track

What the view track needs from the sim and can't add itself (the Producer plans these for the sim
track right after S1/S2 bugs).

1. ~~`Stop`, `HoldPosition`, `AttackMove` command kinds and shift-queued orders~~ → **done in
   M1-7** (session 2330): `Command.Stop/HoldPosition/AttackMove(...)`, `Command.Move(..., queued)`,
   `Command.QueuedFlag`; queue of 8 per unit. M2-3 can start.
2. Public read access to a cached flow field's directions, for the M2-5 debug overlay (flow arrows).
   Candidate to fold into M1-8 if trivial.
3. `DataError.ToString()` shouldn't print `: :` for empty file/path fields (BUG-0041 note; fold into
   the M3 data task).
4. Low priority: a previous-tick facing (`PrevFacing`) so unit views can blend turns; today the
   view snaps yaw per tick (M2-2 note, M2-7 polish).

## Feature queue: sim track (feature sessions, in order)

1. **Next:** M1-8 headless CLI in `tools/` printing checkpoint hashes and tick timings; records and
   plays `.replay` files through `ReplayPlayer`; a console project in the `.sln`, no xUnit
   dependency, BCL only. Fold in request 2 if trivial.
2. **M1 end-of-milestone hardening session**, then sign-off: see the sim debt backlog (BUG-0044,
   0045, 0046, 0047, 0049, 0050, 0054, 0055, 0056, the blank-line nit); coverage ✅ check for every
   M1 system; retro; M3 set to Next.
3. M3 sim side: resource entities, gather/return loop, building placement and construction,
   production queues, Age II, full Malazan and Whirlwind data. Plus any **Requests for the sim
   track** above, which outrank M3 work.
4. M6 (far ahead): agents can't download. The Producer lists under "Waiting on you", when M5
   starts, the exact links for the Godot 4.7.2 .NET export templates and the Kenney/KayKit/Quaternius
   packs (docs/04) with the `asset-sources/` folder for each (owner note 2026-10-05).

## Feature queue: view track (feature sessions, in order)

1. **M2-3 (next):** A attack-move (moves only), S stop, H hold, Shift-queue (the sim's kinds and
   queue are on `main`); double-click type select, control groups, Tab subgroups. Generalise
   `SelectionController.OrderMoveTo` (kind + queued) rather than add a second order path. Don't
   show Hold as a persistent stance once an order is queued after it (BUG-0056 item 3). Production
   budget 500 lines (M2-4 held it: 365).
2. **View hardening session** at 4 / 4 (after M2-3): BUG-0052, BUG-0053, BUG-0064, the dev
   mesh-test wall mutant.
3. M2-5: debug overlay (nav grid, flow arrows, tick-time graph); flow arrows need request 2.
4. M2-6: placeholder audio for select and command (generated tones or CC0 already in repo; no
   downloads by agents).
5. M2-7: playable check, 100 placeholder units at 60 FPS → M2 sign-off (with the M2 hardening
   session). Trees and rocks as MultiMesh wait for M3's resource entities.

## Debt backlog: sim track (hardening sessions only; next one is the M1 end-of-milestone session)

- **BUG-0055 (S3)** own walkers slip past a friendly holding plug in a 1-cell corridor (10 / 30, up
  to 1.05 m overlap). Producer decision: holders become hard walls to their own player (likely
  `|| u.Hold[j]` in `IsHardWall`), measured against `CrowdRoutingTests` and the BUG-0044 perf rows;
  un-skip the QA row. Keep soft + document if the crowd rows fall.
- **BUG-0054 (S3)** `Enqueue` accepts undefined kinds / unknown `Flags` bits; the recorder logs them
  and `ReplayFormat.Write` throws. Make `Enqueue` throw like it does for an unknown player;
  regression test; un-skip the QA row. **BUG-0056 (S4)** item 1 with it (`Flags` on Spawn / Noop);
  item 2 after BUG-0055 (walkers-stay-behind check in the dev corridor test); item 3 by design.
- **BUG-0044 (S3)** two-player 2,500-unit rows 2x slower (contested blob 4.5 → 10.5 ms, 4 points 1.97
  → 3.72 ms; one-player blob 4.5-4.6 vs the 4.5 slice target; 1,000-walker crossing 3.1 → 5.4 ms):
  the `IsPlug` search runs per overlapped enemy in every `Constrain`; cache the plug answer per enemy
  per tick, or run it only next to blocked ground. Then make the tight-blob row enforced (BUG-0047).
- **BUG-0045 (S3, was S2)** plugs of 5+ enemies leak (5 small infantry across a 4 m choke): raise
  `MaxPlugSpan` or make the plug test span-free; 5 QA rows skipped are the proof. Measure against
  BUG-0044.
- **BUG-0049 (S3)** 64-goal bound: seed 51 gives up 75 vs 48 (base 92); re-bound on seeds 1-80 or
  make the row report-only. **BUG-0050 (S3)** random-goal give-ups 23.7 / 500 mean (target 3%) since
  the `QueueOnWaitStride` livelock fix; alternatives measured and listed in docs/03; accept as a known
  limit or find a rule that terminates and recovers it.
- **BUG-0046 (S3)** walker paths depend on neighbours' spawn order (`Constrain` clip order,
  pre-existing; determinism unaffected): fix by sorting clips or document as a known limit.
- **BUG-0047 (S4)** 1 of 4 left (tight-blob row report-only). Nit: three stray blank lines at the top
  of `MovementSystem`'s class body.
- **BUG-0028 / BUG-0032 (S3)** crowd targets (4 points 51% / 34%, 64 goals 19%, same-owner crossing
  22 / 200): needs a crowd cost in the flow fields; not inside M1. Revisit after the M4 sandbox.
- BUG-0040 (S4) part 2: in-tick AI enqueue vs the phase-14 checkpoint is a design note for M5.
- BUG-0025 (S3) evict the live field with the newest order + BUG-0026 (S4) rotate same-tick tie-break.
- BUG-0005 (S3) per-player command buckets (O(n^2) insertion sort under a flood); before M5.
- BUG-0023 (S3) single field build > tick budget on maps > 256: documented as unsupported in docs/03
  (M1-7); time-sliced builds when a larger map is wanted.
- Loader: BUG-0008 (S3) duplicate JSON keys, BUG-0010 (S4) faction slots, `DataError.ToString()`
  empty-field formatting; fold into the M3 data task.
- BUG-0002 (S4) `.sln` Release config maps RtsGame to Debug; with `tools/export.ps1` (M6).
- Perf (Debug, this machine): 500 moving 0.67 ms (criterion test; the older 0.17 ms row measured a
  different scenario); 2,500 units with full queues 3.0 ms; 2,500 one-player tight blob 4.5-4.6 ms;
  two-player 10.5 ms; 1,000 walkers crossing a 1,500 blob 5.4 ms. Replay: 1,000 units x 2,500 ticks
  records in 6.0 s.
- Known limits in docs/03: 4-point crowds 51% / 34%; same-owner blob crossing 22 / 200; stopped
  units can overlap > 40%; back-off-limit pairs at 500-1,000 units; enemies Moving-but-standing are
  soft (a re-ordered plug can leak 2 small units); holders soft to their own army (BUG-0055);
  `NavGrid.Version` not hashed (must join the hash at M3); generator pinned by 15 hashes + QA
  oracles; enqueue stamps `TickNumber + 1`; `SimInfo.Version` recorded in replays but not checked;
  .NET 8 support ends 2026-11-10, move to the next LTS at M6.

## Debt backlog: view track (hardening sessions only)

- BUG-0064 (S4): minimap dots hard to tell from ramp (Whirlwind) and cliff / border (Malazan)
  tints: outline or 2x2 dots; maps over 220 cells skip ~26% of cells under nearest filtering
  (min-filter or screen-space dots); `TryToMap` far-border rounding on letterboxed maps (note).
- BUG-0052 (S3): `TerrainHeight.At` throws for coordinates beyond ~4.3e9 m or +Inf (`(int)` overflow
  before the clamp); one line: clamp in float first. Unreachable while units stay on the map.
- BUG-0053 (S4): `UnitViewsTest` facing check walks +x only (add +y or a diagonal); stale `SimRunner`
  remark about where `Enqueue` lives; docs/03 picker box is -1 to 9 m, not 0 to 9.
- Dev test gap: `TerrainMeshBuilderTests` miss a dropped-wall mutant (only `QA/ViewApi/TerrainMeshQaChecker`
  catches it); add a wall-count assertion on the default map.
- Edge-pan hover suppression (`RtsCamera.EdgePanBlocker`) can't fire today: the minimap's 8 px margin
  keeps it out of the 8 px edge band. Harmless; revisit if the HUD layout changes.
- Export hygiene (M6): exclude `game/tests/` from the release build; load `game/data/` in a way
  that works from a `.pck` (`FileAccess` or copy data next to the exe) instead of
  `ProjectSettings.GlobalizePath("res://data")`.
- Cosmetic: ramp ends ~31° vs 22° mid-ramp (heights at cell centres); no wall skirts on the map
  border (invisible on generated maps); 1024² mesh 904 MiB transient (outside supported sizes);
  `StartLayout` at radius 1.0 puts bodies exactly touching.
- Optional M0 item: Godot MCP server (owner install; not needed since `--screenshot`).
